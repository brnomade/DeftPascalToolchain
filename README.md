# DeftPascalToolchain

A tool chain to automate the build (compile and link) of pascal projects written in Deft Pascal for the Tandy (Radio Shack) TRSCOLOR (a.k.a. CoCo)

Requirements:

- Deft Pascal II V4.1 - http://www.colorcomputerarchive.com/coco/Disks/Programming/Deft%20Pascal%204.1%20(DEFT%20Systems).zip
- AGS Library v16 (for using the graphic primitives and graphic UI objects) - http://www.kenandmartha.com/coco/AGS.html
- Mame 0196b or higher (CoCo emulator where Deft Pascal will run) - http://mamedev.org
- AutoIT v3 or higher - freeware - (to automate the keystrokes when running Deft Pascal) - https://www.autoitscript.com/site/
- Windows (as the .bat files were written on a Windows10 machine) 
- a source code editor (currently I am using Context v0.98.6 - freeware - www.contexteditor.org)
- ROM files for Mame - I am currently emulating a CoCo 2B -  http://www.colorcomputerarchive.com/coco/ROMs/MESS/

For convenience I have assembled a DSK containing the Deft Pascal and AGS Library in a single disk ready for use with Mame. You will find it on the repository.
